Router Overheating Guide

Common causes of router overheating include blocked ventilation,
high ambient temperatures, and sustained CPU usage.

Ensure that air vents are clear and the router is placed in a
well-ventilated area.

In some models, secondary modules may overheat independently
due to localized airflow issues.
